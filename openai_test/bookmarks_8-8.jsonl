{"text": "# [ The LT3000 Blog ](https://lt3000.blogspot.com/) Eclectic musings on value investing, business, economics, and life ## Thursday, 7 November 2019 ### Contrarianism; ESG investing; coal; and climate change It is widely acknowledged in the investment world that one need think and act in a contrarian manner in order to achieve outsized returns and differentiated results. However, despite many claims to contrarianism and 'going against the crowd', its actual practice is vanishingly rare, and the core ingredients that drive effective contrarianism are also often misunderstood. It is not simply a matter of having a disagreeable personality, and disagreeing for the sake of it, or buying a stock simply because it has gone down. Much of what passes for contrarianism these days is actually what I describe as 'faux contrarianism' - buying expensive stocks that have recently become slightly less expensive, but where the fundamental view on the company remains very much in accordance with recent mainstream opinion (and often fails to comprehend new, emergent negative developments which have driven the recent share price decline, but are not yet apparent to all). Market sentiment is like water to fish. Its the medium investors are currently swimming in, without recognising its existence. It's the collection of assumptions and beliefs about reality and the outlook that form the prism through which people assess the prospects of companies and value them. Genuine contrarianism is not about ", "url": "https://lt3000.blogspot.com/2019/11/contrarianism-esg-investing-coal-and.html"}

CGN bought a nearly 20 percent stake for C$82.2 million ($61.63 million) in Fission Uranium Corp, Fission said in December. \"Of course we have interest but it depends on their price,\" said Jianhua Xing, deputy general manager of CGN Uranium Resources Co Ltd, when asked about companies such as NexGen Energy Ltd and Mines Denison, which have uranium development projects in northern Saskatchewan. \"We don't have a specific plan.

I am not at all certain what this means. Often the only sources of renewable electricity are wind turbines and solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, and, to a much lesser extent, geothermal. (Iceland is the only country relying on geothermal.) Both wind and solar energy suffer from what is known as intermittency, because winds have a nasty habit of suddenly dying or springing up, while the sun will disappear behind clouds and provides no power at night.

{"text": "# [ Musings on Markets ](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/) My not-so-profound thoughts about valuation, corporate finance and the news of the day! ## Monday, September 21, 2020 ### Sounding good or Doing good? A Skeptical Look at ESG In my time in corporate finance and valuation, I have seen many \"new and revolutionary\" ideas emerge, each one marketed as the solution to all of the problems that businesses face. Most of the time, these ideas start by repackaging an existing concept or measure and adding a couple of proprietary tweaks that are less improvement and more noise, then get acronyms, before being sold relentlessly. With each one, the magic fades once the limitations come to the surface, as they inevitably do, but not before consultants and bankers have been enriched. So, forgive me for being a cynic when it comes to the latest entrant in this game, where ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance), a measure of the environment and social impact of companies, has become one of the fastest growing movements in business and investing, and this time, the sales pitch is wider and deeper. Companies that improve their social goodness standing will not only become more profitable and valuable over time, we are told, but they will also advance society's best interests, thus resolving one of the fundamental conflicts of private enterprise, while also enriching investors. This week, the ESG debate has come back to take main stage, for three reasons. * It is the fiftieth anni", "url": "http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2020/09/sounding-good-or-doing-good-skeptical.html"}

{"text": "# [p3-insta485-clientside](https://eecs485staff.github.io/p3-insta485-clientside/) # React/JS Tutorial This tutorial will walk you through a simple React/JS application, including JavaScript development tools. ## Install tool chain We need to install a tool chain for our front end. The tool chain provides a few benefits: * Download and install JavaScript libraries * Package JavaScript libraries together with our own code for deployment * Compile modern [ES6](http://es6-features.org/) JavaScript syntax to portable ES5. If you're interested, here's a little [JavaScript history](https://benmccormick.org/2015/09/14/es5-es6-es2016-es-next-whats-going-on-with-javascript-versioning/). * Compile [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html) syntax to portable ES5. JSX is a language extension that lets you embed HTML in a JavaScript program. It's like jinja2 templates, but in JavaScript * Concatenate everything into one JS file for final client consumption * Minify source code (optional) * Obfuscate source code (optional) Our tool chain will consist of a JavaScript interpreter ([`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)) and a package manager ([`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/)). Keep in mind that we aren't running any servers using JavaScript. The tool chain happens to be written in JavaScript so we'll need a JavaScript interpreter to run it. ### Python virtual environment This tutorial assumes you've already created a Python virtual environment.

Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. Itas also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle. The sqlite3 module was written by Gerhard HA$?ring. It provides a SQL interface compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described by [**PEP 249**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249). To use the module, you must first create a `Connection` object that represents the database. Here the data will be stored in the `example.db` file: import sqlite3 con = sqlite3.connect('example.db') You can also supply the special name `:memory:` to create a database in RAM. Once you have a `Connection`, you can ", "url": "https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html"}

{"text": "# EECS 281 Supplemental Class Notes _In Development, 2019-_ Hello everyone! My name is Andrew Zhou, and I was an EECS 281 IA for five semesters, from Fall 2018 to Fall 2020. The following page hosts a collection of class notes that were written for the class, covering all of the material in the course. I began this project in the summer of 2019 as a way to convert the material into an accessible text format, as well as to consolidate all of the information for this class into one location. This resource was definitely something that was requested by a lot of students during my time as an IA, especially since EECS 281 is one of the most important classes in the computer science program. The first 18 chapters of these notes were initially released on the Fall 2020 Piazza forum, and the remaining chapters will be completed sometime in the near future. _The most updated version of the notes will always be available on this page!_ The great thing about EECS 281 is that there is always something new to learn, no matter how much experience you have! Even during my last semester as an IA, I've learned things that I never knew when I first took the class. Hopefully, these notes will make it easier to learn all the concepts in this class, especially as the class size continues to grow each semester. EECS 281 is a challenging class, but it is also a fulfulling one! I wish you the best of luck in this class, and I hope you find these notes helpful.

It maps S(\\mathbf{a}):\\mathbb{R}^{N}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{N}: \\\\[S(\\mathbf{a}):\\begin{bmatrix} a_1\\\\\\ a_2\\\\\\ \\cdots\\\\\\ a_N \\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} S_1\\\\\\ S_2\\\\\\ \\cdots\\\\\\ S_N \\end{bmatrix}\\\\] And the actual per-element formula is: \\\\[S_j=\\frac{e^{a_j}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N}e^{a_k}} \\qquad \\forall j \\in 1..N\\\\] It's easy to see that S_j is always positive (because of the exponents); moreover, since the numerator appears in the denominator summed up with some other positive numbers, S_j<1. Therefore, it's in the range (0, 1). For example, the 3-element vector `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` gets transformed into `[0.09, 0.24, 0.67]`. The order of elements by relative size is preserved, and they add up to 1.0. Let's tweak this vector", "url": "https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2016/the-softmax-function-and-its-derivative/"}

That's probably the number one question people ask me. I'd like to reply with another question: why do people think it's hard to come up with ideas for startups? That might seem a stupid thing to ask. Why do they _think_ it's hard? If people can't do it, then it _is_ hard, at least for them. Right? Well, maybe not. What people usually say is not that they can't think of ideas, but that they don't have any. That's not quite the same thing. It could be the reason they don't have any is that they haven't tried to generate them. I think this is often the case. I think people believe that coming up with ideas for startups is very hard-- that it _must_ be very hard-- and so they don't try do to it. They assume ideas are like miracles: they either pop into your head or they don't. I also have a theory about why people think this. They overvalue ideas. They think creating a startup is just a mat", "url": "http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html"}

It's an experiment because we're prepared to fund younger founders than most investors would. That's why we're doing it during the summer--so even college students can participate. We know from Google and Yahoo that grad students can start successful startups. And we know from experience that some undergrads are as capable as most grad students. The accepted age for startup founders has been creeping downward. We're trying to find the lower bound. The deadline has now passed, and we're sifting through 227 applications. We expected to divide them into two categories, promising and unpromising. But we soon saw we needed a third: promising people with unpromising ideas.

A sizable chunk of the historic $5t in spending actually ended up in the hands of the general public via various types of transfer payments and grants. That money was essentially created out of thin air by the Fed and then spent into the economy by the Treasury. Observing the Fed's growing balance sheet offers a glimpse as to the scale of the printing, but it does not reveal where the money ends up. Generally speaking, the created money ends up as a deposit liability in the banking system. Banks must file detailed regulatory reports on their deposit liabilities, so it is possible have an idea of the type of depositors who ultimately benefited from the government's largess. In this post we first review the GFC era policy response, show how the distribution of money this time is now more favorable towards retail, and suggest that this change is contributing to inflation. ![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)![](ht", "url": "https://fedguy.com/follow-the-money/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=follow-the-money&s=09"}

Some traders have played with it short-term due to the global reflationary rebound, but few investors are willing to commit to it long-term at this point. It's nothing more than a post-pandemic transitory bump in most peoples' minds. The general consensus is that solar and wind technologies will take the oil and gas sector down over time, so there isn't much opportunity left. Investors piled into the sector a decade ago, constantly providing funding to shale companies that destroyed capital with drilling activities that were not free cash flow positive, while oil majors made bad acquisitions at cycle highs and suffered major write-downs as well.

Part 3 - an effect doesn't run again when its dependencies change [ ![Cogs](/static/cogs-b40eef1b0d0788f190c1a290e0a522b2-19371.jpg) ](/static/cogs-b40eef1b0d0788f190c1a290e0a522b2-20657.jpg) In the previous post from [the React hooks... Oops! series](https://coder.earth/post/react-hooks-oops-part-1-introduction) we talked about a case where [an effect is re-applied, even though the dependencies are still \"the same\"](https://coder.earth/post/react-hooks-oops- part-2-effect-runs-multiple-times-with-the-same-dependencies). We expected it to run again only if the dependencies changed, but it ended up running multiple times with the same values. Fortunately, it was enough to learn a little bit about how dependencies are compared, and it became clear what made React re-apply it. dY=3 If you're reading this post, you might have already discovered that the array of dependencies is tricky. It seems to be pretty simple on the surface. After all, it just tells React to \"re-run this function when one of these values change\", right? Well, that's not exactly what happens. **The truth is that changing a value in the dependency list is not enough for React to re-run the effect!** How come? ddeg Let's have a look at a very simple example, where everything works as expected: function App() { // Just some local state: const [typed, setTyped] = useState(\"\"); // An effect synchronized with ", "url": "https://coder.earth/post/react-hooks-oops-part-3-an-effect-does-not-run-again-when-its-dependencies-change"}

Some traders have played with it short-term due to the global reflationary rebound, but few investors are willing to commit to it long-term at this point. It's nothing more than a post-pandemic transitory bump in most peoples' minds. The general consensus is that solar and wind technologies will take the oil and gas sector down over time, so there isn't much opportunity left. Investors piled into the sector a decade ago, constantly providing funding to shale companies that destroyed capital with drilling activities that were not free cash flow positive, while oil majors made bad acquisitions at cycle highs and suffered major write-downs as well.

The best way to meet co-founders is to go to school with them, so recent grads have a big advantage there. You can also meet co-founders at work, but be careful not to violate whatever noncompete you signed. In the old days, co- founders often met through user groups, but this seems less common now. **How can someone start a startup if they have a family to support?** The best plan might be to start a consulting business that you can gradually morph into a startup. This way you always have a source of income. See [How to Fund a Startup](startupfunding.html), especially the section labelled \"Consulting.\" **Do you know of any good books about startups?** The how-to type of books are generally wretched. Many are downright mistaken. The best source of information about startups is probably not business books, but histories of particular startups and industries. The most famous is Tracy Kidder's _Soul of a New Machine_ , but there are many good books of this type. I particularly liked Sorensen's _My Forty Years with Ford_. The one book we encourage startup founders", "url": "http://www.paulgraham.com/startupfaq.html"}

They both seem from the outside like great abstruse mysteries. You can learn great abstruse mysteries as a teenager, because everything is a mystery at that point anyway. And you have the boundless self confidence that comes from ignorance. But unless you learn both as a teenager, which is rare, you'll be afraid of the other later. **What should I read to learn more about history?** The way to do it is piecemeal. You could just sit down and try reading Roberts's _History of the World_ cover to cover, but you'd probably lose interest. I think it's a better plan to read books about specific topics, even if you don't understand everything the first time through.

[Click here to enter the contest!](https://worksheets.codalab.org/worksheets/0x7a8721f11e61436e93ac8f76da83f0e6) ## About the competition A collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Landing AI, the Data-Centric AI Competition aims to elevate data-centric approaches to improving the performance of machine learning models. In most machine learning competitions, you are asked to build a high- performance model given a fixed dataset. However, machine learning has matured to the point that high-performance model architectures are widely available, while approaches to engineering datasets have lagged. The Data-Centric AI Competition inverts the traditional format and instead asks you to improve a dataset given a fixed model. We will provide you with a dataset to improve by applying data-centric techniques such as fixing incorrect labels, adding examples that represent edge cases, apply data augmentation, etc. Contestants must submit their altered dataset for evaluation by **September 4, 2021. 6PM PT** (We picked this date because it is the birthday of John McCarthy, who had coined the term artificial intelligence!) The top three winners from each of the two categories (Best Performance Overall and Most Innovative) will be invited to a private event with Andrew Ng to share ideas about how to grow the data-centric movement, and will be highlighted in The Batch and ", "url": "https://https-deeplearning-ai.github.io/data-centric-comp/"}

Resource Upgrade - Shelf Margin Deltaic Pantheon is pleased to report that it has now completed its internal analysis of the SMD-B sequence encountered in the Talitha #A well. The SMD is the shallowest of five discrete oil bearing intervals encountered in that well. The SMD interval itself is comprised of three individual components: the SMD-A, the SMD-B and the SMD-C. The excellent quality data obtained in Talitha #A has allowed Pantheon to integrate well log response and core data with seismic petrophysics to more accurately map this interval. Pantheon has completed its analysis of the SMD-B zone, one of the three zones within the SMD, and estimates that this zone has the potential to contain 2.6 billion barrels oil in place (\"OIP\") and a P50 Contingent Resource (recoverable) of 404 million barrels oil (\"mmbo\").

Virtual Environments and PackagesAP ## 12.1. IntroductionAP Python applications will often use packages and modules that donat come as part of the standard library. Applications will sometimes need a specific version of a library, because the application may require that a particular bug has been fixed or the application may be written using an obsolete version of the libraryas interface. This means it may not be possible for one Python installation to meet the requirements of every application. If application A needs version 1.0 of a particular module but application B needs version 2.0, then the requirements are in conflict and installing either version 1.0 or 2.0 will leave one application unable to run. The solution for this problem is to create a [virtual environment](../glossary.html#term-virtual-environment), a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages. Different applications can then use different virtual environments. To resolve the earlier example of conflicting requirements, applicati", "url": "https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html"}

This query uses a [syntax](query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string- syntax \"Query string syntax\") to parse and split the provided query string based on operators, such as `AND` or `NOT`. The query then [analyzes](analysis.html \"Text analysis\") each split text independently before returning matching documents. You can use the `query_string` query to create a complex search that includes wildcard characters, searches across multiple fields, and more. While versatile, the query is strict and returns an error if the query string includes any invalid syntax. Because it returns an error for any invalid syntax, we don't recommend using the `query_string` query for search boxes. If you don't need to support a query syntax, consider using the [`match`](query-dsl-match-query.html \"Match query\") query.

What was special about the Airbnbs was how earnest they were. They did nothing half-way, and we could sense this even in the interview. Sometimes after we interviewed a startup we'd be uncertain what to do, and have to talk it over. Other times we'd just look at one another and smile. The Airbnbs' interview was that kind. We didn't even like the idea that much. Nor did users, at that stage; they had no growth. But the founders seemed so full of energy that it was impossible not to like them. That first impression was not misleading. During the batch our nickname for Brian Chesky was The Tasmanian Devil, because like the [cartoon character](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StG2u5qfFRg&t=2m27s) he seemed a tornado of energy. All three of them were like that. No one ever worked harder during YC than the Airbnbs did. When you talked to the Airbnbs, they took notes. If you suggested an idea to them in office hours, the next time you talked to them they'd not only have implemented it, but also implemented two new ideas they had in the process. \"They probably have the best attitude of any startup we've funded\" I wr", "url": "http://www.paulgraham.com/airbnbs.html"}
