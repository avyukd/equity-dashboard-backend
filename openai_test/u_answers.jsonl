{"text": "It contains 45 country reports on uranium exploration, resources, production and reactor-related requirements, 31 of which were derived from officially reported government data, and 14 that were prepared by the NEA and IAEA Scientific Secretaries."}
{"text": "Projections of nuclear generating capacity and reactor-related uranium requirements through 2040 are presented, as well as a discussion of long-term uranium supply and demand issues."}
{"text": "Resources Global uranium resources have once again increased, but much more modestly so than reported in recent editions, as total identified recoverable resources increased by only 1% since 2017."}
{"text": "The most significant increases occurred in lower cost reasonably assured resources (<USD 40/kgU) and higher cost inferred resources (<USD 130/kgU and <USD 260/kgU)."}
{"text": "Though a portion of these changes relate to new discoveries (e.g."}
{"text": "Canada), the majority result from newly identified resources at known uranium deposits and re-evaluations of previously identified uranium resources."}
{"text": "Uranium resources are classified by a scheme (based on geological certainty and costs of production) developed to combine resource estimates from a number of different countries into harmonised global figures."}
{"text": "Identified resources (which include reasonably assured resources, or RAR, and inferred resources) refer to uranium deposits delineated by sufficient direct measurement to conduct prefeasibility and sometimes feasibility studies."}
{"text": "For RAR, high confidence in estimates of grade and tonnage are generally compatible with mining decision-making standards."}
{"text": "Inferred resources are not defined with such a high degree of confidence and generally require further direct measurement prior to making a decision to mine."}
{"text": "Undiscovered resources (prognosticated and speculative) refer to resources that are expected to exist based on geological knowledge of previously discovered deposits and regional geological mapping."}
{"text": "Prognosticated resources refer to those expected to exist in known uranium provinces, generally supported by some direct evidence."}
{"text": "Speculative resources refer to those expected to exist in geological provinces that may host uranium deposits."}
{"text": "Both prognosticated and speculative resources require significant amounts of exploration before their existence can be confirmed and grades and tonnages can be defined."}
{"text": "Unconventional resources are defined as very low-grade resources or those from which uranium is only recoverable as a minor by-product or co-product."}
{"text": "For a more detailed description, see Appendix 3."}
{"text": "Globally, Australia continues to lead with 28% of the world identified resources in the category <USD 130/kgU (equivalent to USD 50/lb U3O8), with over 64% of Australia's national total endowment related to a single site, the world class Olympic Dam deposit."}
{"text": "In terms of lower cost resources (<USD 80/kgU and <USD 40/kgU, equivalent to USD 30/lb U3O8 and USD 15/lb U3O8), Kazakhstan leads with 49% and 36% of the world total, respectively."}
{"text": "Moreover, Kazakhstan reported overall increases in resources in all cost categories, owing to exploration efforts and monetary currency exchanges."}
{"text": "Noteworthy changes in resources also occurred in other major producing countries, such as in Australia, Canada and Namibia, where ongoing assessment of resources led to adjustments in resource values."}
{"text": "URANIUM 2020: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No."}
{"text": "7551, (c) OECD 2020 9 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Total identified resources recoverable (reasonably assured and inferred) as of 1 January 2019 amounted to 6 147 800 tonnes of uranium metal (tU) in the <USD 130/kgU category, a slight increase of 0.1% compared to 2017."}
{"text": "In the highest cost category (<USD 260/kgU), total identified resources amounted to 8 070 400 tU, an increase of 1% compared to the total reported for the previous edition."}
{"text": "Reasonably assured resources (RAR) decreased by about 2-3% in all high cost categories."}
{"text": "The most notable changes in RAR are reported in the <USD 80/kgU category, with a decrease of 2.8%, and in the <USD 40/kgU category, with an increase of 4.4%, compared to values reported in 2017."}
{"text": "The overall changes in RAR can be primarily attributed to mining depletion or re-evaluation of uranium resources in countries such as Australia, China, Namibia and new resources identified as a result of exploration activities in Canada and Kazakhstan."}
{"text": "In comparison, inferred resources in the <USD 260/kgU cost category increased overall from 3 173 000 tU in 2017 to 3 346 400 tU (5.5%) in 2019, mainly due to the re-evaluation of resources, with Australia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Niger reporting the most significant increases."}
{"text": "A summary has been prepared of worldwide in situ identified resources."}
{"text": "Overall, when they are reported as in situ instead of recoverable, resources increase by 17% to 31%."}
{"text": "Compared with the previous edition, the total identified in situ resources slightly decreased from 10 652 900 tU to 10 584 500 tU."}
{"text": "Reporting in situ resources provides a more optimistic view of the available resource base and gives some indication of how the resource base could increase with improvements in mining and processing methods, which would lead to better recovery."}
{"text": "Additions to the conventional resource base in the future could come from undiscovered resources (prognosticated resources and speculative resources), which as of 1 January 2019 amounted to 7 220 300 tU, a 4% decrease from the 7 530 600 tU reported in the previous edition."}
{"text": "Unconventional resources are another source of potential future supply, and currently amount to nearly 39 million tU."}
{"text": "It is important to note that in some cases, including those of major producing countries with large identified resource inventories, estimates of undiscovered resources and unconventional resources are either not reported or have not been updated for several years."}
{"text": "The uranium resource figures presented in this volume are a snapshot of the situation as of 1 January 2019."}
{"text": "Readers should keep in mind that resource figures are dynamic and related to commodity prices."}
{"text": "Exploration and mining development Continuing a downward trend over several years, worldwide domestic exploration and mine development expenditures decreased to approximately USD 0.5 billion in 2018, a large drop from USD 2 billion in 2014."}
{"text": "Non-domestic figures, a subset of global exploration and development expenditures, declined to under USD 0.07 billion in 2018."}
{"text": "Total expenditures continue to decrease in response to a sustained depressed uranium market since mid-2011."}
{"text": "From 2014 to 2015, total expenditures dropped from over USD 2 billion to USD 876.5 million, followed by a decline to USD 681.9 million in 2016, and have since continued to decline to USD 482.9 million in 2018."}
{"text": "Reported 2018 global expenditures represent a 75% drop in exploration and mine development expenditures reported in 2012."}
{"text": "Expenditures decreased in many countries, mainly because of persistently depressed uranium prices that slowed down several exploration and mine development projects."}
{"text": "Of the countries reporting exploration and mine development expenditures from 2016 through 2018, the total over this three-year period amounted to USD 1.8 billion with Canada, China, India, the United States and Kazakhstan leading the way."}
{"text": "Expenditures in Canada alone exceeded the total spending of the remaining top five countries."}
{"text": "From 2016 to 2019, the global share of exploration drilling has increased from 61% to 76% of total expenditures."}
{"text": "Canada, China and Kazakhstan accounted for just over 93% of the exploration drilling length reported in 2016 and 2017, declining slightly to 88% in 2018 and to 84% of the world total in 2019 (preliminary data)."}
{"text": "10 URANIUM 2020: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No."}
{"text": "7551, (c) OECD 2020 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Production Global uranium mine production decreased by nearly 11% from 2017 to 2018, but experienced a slight increase of 1% in 2019."}
{"text": "Major producing countries, including Canada and Kazakhstan, limited total production in recent years in response to a sustained depressed uranium market."}
{"text": "Uranium production cuts have been unexpectedly deepened with the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020."}
{"text": "New to this edition, is a uranium resource and annual production capacity of idled mines."}
{"text": "These operations could potentially be brought back into production relatively rapidly with appropriate market signals."}
{"text": "As of 1 January 2019, 16 countries reported producing uranium, with the global total amounting to 53 516 tU."}
{"text": "World production increased slightly to 54 224 tU in 2019, mainly through increases in Australia, Kazakhstan and Niger."}
{"text": "Kazakhstan's continuous growth in production came to an end in 2017 as production cuts were instituted to reduce supply to an oversupplied market."}
{"text": "Kazakhstan nonetheless remained by far the world's largest producer, even as production was eased back to 23 391 tU in 2017 and 21 705 tU in 2018."}
{"text": "Kazakhstan's 2018 production alone totalled more than the combined production in that year from Canada, Australia and Namibia, respectively the second, third and fourth largest producers of uranium."}
{"text": "Production by in situ leaching (ISL) remained the dominant technology through the reporting period, accounting for over 55% of total global uranium production in 2018 and approximately 57% in 2019."}
{"text": "Overall, world uranium production decreased by 4.7% from 62 997 tU in 2016 to 60 025 tU in 2017, then by a further 10.8% to 53 516 tU in 2018 as producers instituted production cuts."}
{"text": "These planned reductions were greatest in Canada, Kazakhstan and Niger."}
{"text": "In Canada, for example, Rabbit Lake mine was suspended in mid-2016, then mining at the McArthur River and milling at Key Lake was suspended at the end of January 2018, all due to an unfavourable market."}
{"text": "Production also declined dramatically in the United States."}
{"text": "These actions are in addition to a list of 14 idled mines those with associated identified uranium resources and mining/processing facilities that have all necessary licenses, permits and agreements for operation and have produced commercially in the past that amount to over 27 500 tU of annual production capacity and could potentially be brought back into production relatively rapidly with appropriate market signals."}
{"text": "Planned uranium production cuts have been unexpectedly deepened with the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020."}
{"text": "In March 2020, Canada announced that it had suspended production at the Cigar Lake mine and McClean Lake mill to slow the spread of COVID-19."}
{"text": "In early April 2020, Kazakhstan also announced that it was reducing operational activities at all uranium mines."}
{"text": "The pandemic also caused restrictions at other mining operations, such as in Australia, Namibia or South Africa."}
{"text": "In August 2020, some of these restrictions began to be eased and several producers gradually resumed production."}
{"text": "However, with these unplanned reductions, 2020 uranium production targets will be a challenge to achieve, and effects of pandemic-related restrictions on mining and milling could be felt through 2021 and beyond."}
{"text": "Environmental and social aspects of uranium exploration and production With uranium production projected to expand to meet global demand in the mid-term, efforts are being made to develop safe mining practices and to continue to minimise environmental impacts."}
{"text": "Brief overviews in the country reports provide information about the status of environmental and social aspects of uranium mining, including site remediation and decommissioning projects, which highlights the progress that the uranium industry has made on environmental stewardship."}
{"text": "Although the focus of this publication remains uranium resources, production and demand, the environmental and social aspects of the uranium production cycle are gaining increasing importance and, as in the last few editions, updates on activities in this area have been included in the country reports."}
{"text": "With a need for increased uranium production to meet demand, the continued development of transparent, safe and well-regulated operations that minimise environmental impacts is crucial, particularly for those countries hosting uranium production for the first time."}

{"text": "7551, (c) OECD 2020 11 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY For this edition, 25 countries provided information on activities related to environmental aspects of uranium production cycle, including ongoing work related to closed facilities."}
{"text": "Additional information on environmental aspects of uranium production may be found in Managing Environmental and Health Impacts of Uranium Mining (NEA, 20141), which outlines significant improvements that have been undertaken in these areas since the early strategic period of uranium mining to the present day."}
{"text": "More recently, the IAEA Bulletin, Uranium: From Exploration to Remediation (IAEA, 20182) includes some information on this topic."}
{"text": "Uranium demand Nuclear capacity is expected to rise for the foreseeable future as global energy demand is projected to increase and due to the growing need for a clean energy transition."}

{"text": "Annual uranium requirements are projected to be largest in the East Asia region."}
{"text": "Recognising the security of supply, reliability and predictability that nuclear power offers and promoting incentives for all types of low-carbon technologies, are key conditions for a greater projected growth in nuclear capacity, and consequently, in uranium demand."}
{"text": "As of 1 January 2019, a total of 450 commercial nuclear reactors were connected to the grid globally, with a net generating capacity of 396 GWe requiring about 59 200 tU annually."}
{"text": "Taking into account changes in policies announced in several countries and revised nuclear programmes, world nuclear capacity is projected to grow to between 354 GWe net in the low demand case and about 626 GWe net in the high demand case by 2040."}
{"text": "The low case represents a decrease of about 11% from 2018 nuclear generating capacity, while the high case represents an increase of about 58%."}
{"text": "Accordingly, world annual reactor-related uranium requirements (excluding mixed oxide fuel [MOX]) are projected to rise to between 56 640 tU and 100 225 tU by 2040."}
{"text": "Nuclear capacity projections vary considerably from region to region."}
{"text": "The East Asia region is projected to experience the largest increase, which, by the year 2040, could result in increases of more than 24% and 138% over 2018 capacity in the low and high cases, respectively."}
{"text": "While representing significant regional capacity increases, it is important to note that countries in this region (e.g."}
{"text": "China) have demonstrated the ability to build multiple reactors with predictable costs and schedules."}
{"text": "Nuclear capacity in non-EU member countries on the European continent is also projected to increase considerably, with 66 GWe of capacity projected by 2040 in the high case (increases of about 50% over 2018 capacity)."}
{"text": "Other regions projected to experience significant nuclear capacity growth include the Middle East, Central and Southern Asia, with more modest growth projected in Africa, Central and South America, and the South-eastern Asia regions."}
{"text": "For North America, the projections see nuclear generating capacity decreasing by 2040 in both the low and high cases, depending largely on future electricity demand, lifetime extension of existing reactors and government policies with respect to greenhouse gas emissions."}
{"text": "The reality of financial losses in several reactors in the United States has resulted in a larger number of premature shutdowns to be assumed."}
{"text": "In the European Union, nuclear capacity in 2040 is projected to decrease by 52% in the low case scenario and decrease by 8% in the high case, if actual policies are maintained."}
{"text": "As in the case of nuclear capacity, uranium requirements vary considerably from region to region, reflecting projected capacity increases and possible inventory building."}
{"text": "Annual uranium requirements are projected to be largest in the East Asia region, where an increase in installed nuclear generating capacity drives significant growth in uranium needs."}

{"text": "Supply and demand relationship The currently defined resource base is more than adequate to meet low and high case uranium demand through 2040, but doing so will depend upon timely investments to turn resources into production."}
{"text": "Nonetheless, meeting high case demand requirements to 2040 would consume about 87% of the total 2019 identified resource base recoverable at a cost of <USD 80/kgU (equivalent USD 30/lb U3O8)."}
{"text": "Challenges remain with depressed market prices and other concerns in mine development include geopolitical factors, technical challenges and legal and regulatory frameworks."}
{"text": "As of 1 January 2019, world uranium production provided nearly 90% of world reactor requirements, whereas in 2017, global primary production provided about 95% of requirements, with the remainder supplied by so-called secondary sources."}
{"text": "The secondary supply includes excess government and commercial inventories, spent fuel reprocessing, underfeeding and uranium produced by the re-enrichment of depleted uranium tails, as well as low-enriched uranium (LEU) produced by blending down highly enriched uranium (HEU)."}
{"text": "Uranium producers vigorously responded to the market signal of increased prices and projections of rapidly rising demand prior to the Fukushima Daiichi accident."}
{"text": "However, the continued decline in uranium market prices following the accident and lingering uncertainty about nuclear power development in some countries has at least temporarily reduced uranium requirements, further depressed prices and slowed the pace of mine production and development."}
{"text": "More recently, the significant temporary rise in the spot price seen in the spring 2020 (about USD 34/lb U3O8 equivalent to USD 88/kgU), was precipitated largely by additional curtailments to primary production brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic."}
{"text": "Readers should note that the reduction in uranium mining operations due to the pandemic is not expected to create performance disruptions of nuclear power reactors in the near term, as significant inventories are held by utilities and fuel cycle producers."}
{"text": "For the foreseeable future, projected primary uranium production capabilities, including existing, committed, planned and prospective production centres, would satisfy projected low case and partially high case requirements through 2040 if developments proceed as planned."}
{"text": "Meeting high case demand requirements to 2040 would consume less than 28% of the total 2019 identified resource base recoverable at a cost of < USD 130/kgU (USD 50/lb U3O8)."}
{"text": "However, when considering lower cost resources, in the light of current market prices, meeting projected high case requirements to 2040 would consume about 87% of identified resources at a cost USD 80/kgU (<USD 30/lb U3O8)."}
{"text": "Nonetheless, significant investment and technical expertise will be required to bring these resources to the market."}
{"text": "Producers will have to overcome a number of significant and, at times, unpredictable issues in bringing new production facilities on stream, including geopolitical and local factors, technical challenges and legal and regulatory frameworks."}
{"text": "To do so, strong market conditions will be critical for achieving the required industry investment."}
{"text": "Although declining market prices have led to significant reductions in uranium production and a delay in some mine development projects, other projects have advanced through regulatory and further stages of development."}
{"text": "An improvement of uranium market conditions should see at least some of the delayed projects or the idled mines reactivated in order to ensure supply to a growing global nuclear fleet."}

{"text": "Nevertheless, utilities have been building significant inventory over the last few years at reduced prices, which should help to protect them from such events in the near term."}
{"text": "Although information on secondary sources is incomplete, the availability of these sources is generally expected to decline somewhat after 2020."}
{"text": "However, available information indicates that there remains a significant amount of previously mined uranium, some of which could feasibly be brought to the market in the coming years."}
{"text": "With the enrichment capacity at least temporarily in excess of requirements, enrichment providers are well-positioned to reduce tails assays below contractual requirements and thereby create additional uranium supply."}
{"text": "In the longer term, alternative fuel cycles, if successfully developed and implemented, could have a significant impact on the uranium market, but it is too early to say how cost-effective and widely implemented these proposed alternative fuel cycles could be."}
{"text": "Conclusions Sufficient uranium resources exist to support continued use of nuclear power and significant growth in nuclear capacity for low-carbon electricity generation and other uses (e.g."}
{"text": "heat, hydrogen production) in the long term."}
{"text": "Identified recoverable resources, including reasonably assured resources and inferred resources (at a cost <USD 260/kgU, equivalent to USD 100/lb U3O8) are sufficient for over 135 years, considering uranium requirements as of 1 January 2019."}
{"text": "However, considerable exploration, innovative techniques and timely investment will be required to turn these resources into refined uranium ready for nuclear fuel production and to facilitate the deployment of promising nuclear technologies."}
{"text": "In the wake of recent significant reductions in uranium production and the effects of COVID-19 pandemic, the coming challenges are likely to be those associated with constrained investment capabilities, as a result of depressed market conditions that will push the industry to optimise its activities still further."}

{"text": "Existing and proven mining technologies are used to create and test a novel application of the ISL mining method, which is typically used for low-grade sandstone-hosted uranium deposits."}
{"text": "The method creates conditions necessary for ISL mining in a geologic environment where ISL was previously not considered applicable, and includes i) the application of ground freezing technology to establish a physical form of containment (via a \"freeze wall\") around the deposit, ii) the construction of an ISL wellfield within the freeze wall (approximately 300 recovery, injection and monitoring wells, which will intersect the deposit at approximately 400 metres depth), and iii) the augmentation of natural hydrogeological flow paths in the ore body using permeability enhancement techniques, which facilitates increased contact between the lixiviant and orebody, yielding greater uranium recovery, as well as potentially normalising the variations in mineralisation (grade) and geologic structure throughout the deposit."}
{"text": "Injection pressure and pumping rates direct the lixiviant through the wellfield, simulating (to some degree) the natural \"sweep\" of traditional ISL mining."}
{"text": "Owing to the high-grade at Phoenix, ISL wellfield operations can further be paired with a simple (direct precipitation) on-site processing facility, which has the potential to minimise discharge of treated effluent to the environment by creating a closed-loop circuit from wellfield to processing plant."}

{"text": "In the early 90s Cameco, supported by its joint venture partners, set out to develop a new mining method that could safely and successfully extract uranium at its high-grade Cigar Lake deposit in the Athabasca Basin, Canada."}
{"text": "Due to the presence of water and ground instability issues in the ore body, mining by conventional methods was not possible."}
{"text": "In 1992, researchers conducted underground tests in the ore body comparing various mining methods, and one year later, concluded that jet boring had the most potential."}
{"text": "Jet boring uses water under high pressure to carve out cavities in the ore body."}
{"text": "The resulting ore slurry is then collected through a network of pipes, run through underground grinding and thickening circuits, and then pumped to the surface."}
{"text": "At the Cigar Lake deposit a major challenge for mining was the water surrounding the deposit, and this resulted in significant delays in the start-up of mining due to water inflows in 2006 and 2008."}
{"text": "To overcome this, they began freezing the ore body, which not only stabilises ground conditions and prevents water inflow, but also provides additional protection to workers from radon gas emissions."}
{"text": "The freezing technique is also used at the McArthur River mine to provide ground control for development, while using the raisebore method to mine the orebody."}

{"text": "The fact that production increased during a period of depressed uranium market prices can be attributed to the long planning times and investment required to establish new mines and bring new production to the market, as well as the time it takes to respond to changing market conditions."}
{"text": "Increasing global production in this period was essentially a response to increased demand and uranium market prices beginning over a decade ago."}

{"text": "(***) Trekkopje, although not fully satisfying the definition of an idled mine, is included here because it produced 251 tU and 186 tU in 2012 and 2013 (respectively) as part of two pre-commercial operation pilot tests to demonstrate and confirm production technical processes and estimated costs (see the Namibia country report for additional details; includes both the Klein Trekkopje and Trekkopje deposits)."}
{"text": "Currently, a care and maintenance team regularly provides upkeep to the mine's infrastructure so that it can be recommissioned and brought on stream when economic conditions for uranium production become more favourable."}
{"text": "As shown in Table 1.26, annual production capacity could be potentially increased relatively rapidly if the listed idled mines are brought back into service with improved market conditions."}
{"text": "Although each mine operation is unique in terms of operational costs and a threshold price for opening, the ability to raise capital if required to resume operation and regulatory requirements, idled mines could resume production within roughly one year, given that all permits and licences remain in place."}
{"text": "Decisions to resume production rest principally on increased market prices."}
{"text": "With the right market signals, idled mine facilities, associated with a total of at least 294 000 tU in local resources (recoverable), could potentially bring some 27 000 tU annually to the market if all are brought back into production."}
{"text": "These facilities can be expected to be brought back online before new mines are established, should uranium market conditions improve."}
{"text": "Operations to recover uranium from gold tailings in South Africa could also contribute to increased global production relatively rapidly with the right market signals, and production at Somair (Niger) could be returned to full capacity (capacity reduced by 30% in 2017 due to poor market conditions)."}

{"text": "Improved market conditions and significant investment, however, would be required to bring operations like these on stream (note that Trekkopje is included in the list of idled mines, while Imouraren is listed in Table 1.25; see Table 1.26 footnotes for additional details)."}
{"text": "Conclusions Sufficient uranium resources have been identified to support even the most aggressive scenarios of growth in nuclear generating capacity."}
{"text": "However, the majority of this in-ground uranium cannot be brought to the market without improved market conditions."}
{"text": "Unattractive market conditions also slows uranium exploration investment, which in turn can affect further delineation of additional identified resources in the short term."}
{"text": "At market prices as of late 2020, less than 25% of the identified conventional resource base outlined in this edition could be economically brought into production, since resources with estimated mining costs greater than USD 80/kgU (USD 30.80/lb U3O8) cannot be profitably mined at these market prices."}
{"text": "However, since some producers have either idled production facilities or reduced production at other mines due to a lengthy period of low uranium prices, there is an ability to increase production more rapidly than the traditional lengthy mine development processes of the recent past."}
{"text": "Except for idled projects, significant investment and time would be required to bring uranium resources into production, particularly for undiscovered or unconventional resources."}
{"text": "Historically, significant proportions of identified resources have never been extracted, while, on average, the timelines for extraction of identified resources are on the order of a decade or more (IAEA, 2020), in addition to timeframes of several decades for the delineation of undiscovered resources."}
{"text": "Looking ahead, effects related to efforts to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus at production facilities will likely lead to a further, unplanned reduction in production that will test the market's ability to continue supplying an adequate supply of uranium to the global nuclear fuel supply chain."}
{"text": "As such, 2020 uranium production targets may be a challenge to achieve, and the consequences of pandemic-related restrictions on mining and milling could be felt through 2021, constricting global supply of newly mined uranium."}

{"text": "Energy availability and capacity (or load) factors have increased to over 80% in the period 2000-2010 (IAEA, 2020)."}
{"text": "Increased load factors tend to increase uranium requirements."}

{"text": "Successful deployment of laser enrichment to re-enrich depleted uranium tails could bring a significant source of secondary supply to the uranium market in the mid-term, although technological hurdles remain to be overcome before commercial deployment can be achieved."}
{"text": "In the United States, development of the GE-Hitachi laser enrichment technology has slowed, reflecting depressed market conditions."}
{"text": "The combined impact of strategies to optimise reactor operation and fuel costs, as well as unanticipated reactor closures and the idling of reactors in Japan, are evident in the uranium requirements data collected for this edition, since global requirements have decreased from 63 875 in 2011 to 57 980 tU in 2015 and increased to 59 200 tU as of 1 January 2019."}

{"text": "Following the Fukushima Daiichi accident, public acceptance of the safety of nuclear energy will require greater attention and this remains a pivotal issue in Japan."}
{"text": "Declining electricity demand in several developed countries, the low cost of natural gas in the United States, competition from renewable energy sources and the challenge of raising the significant investment required for capital-intensive projects with lengthy regulatory approval and construction times like NPPs, has made nuclear power development generally more challenging, particularly in liberalised energy markets."}
{"text": "However, despite these challenges and the reaction of a few countries to back away from nuclear power following the Fukushima Daiichi accident (i.e."}

{"text": "The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a decrease in the supply of uranium as main producers suspended uranium operations and closed temporarily their mines."}
{"text": "In April 2020, Kazatomprom, Kazakhstan's stateowned uranium production company announced that it would halt new wellfield development, reduce the number of staff onsite to minimum possible levels and a reduction in production volumes by up to 4 000 tU is expected."}
{"text": "In August, the company began returning staff to the mine sites and has continued with remote work where possible."}
{"text": "Similarly, at the Cigar Lake mine and the McClean Lake uranium mill in northern Saskatchewan, Canada, production was temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 crisis with the workforce onsite declining."}
{"text": "Since September, Cigar Lake/McClean restarted gradually their operations, nevertheless, a reduction of about 40% of production output is expected for 2020."}
{"text": "Mining activities were also suspended in Namibia and South Africa."}
{"text": "However, from the end of April, mines in South Africa were allowed to open but could only operate at 50% capacity."}
{"text": "The Rossing mine in Namibia had also discontinued mining operations."}
{"text": "Nevertheless, the suspension of uranium mining activity is not expected to create performance disruptions of nuclear power reactors in the near term due to significant stocks held by utilities and fuel cycle producers (see further section on stocks and inventories)."}
{"text": "Of the 30 countries currently using uranium in commercial NPPs, only Canada and South Africa produced enough uranium in 2018 to meet domestic requirements (see Figure 2.6), thereby creating an uneven distribution between producing and consuming countries."}

{"text": "7551, (c) OECD 2020 95 URANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP Secondary sources of uranium supply Uranium is unique among energy fuel resources in that historically, a significant portion of demand has been supplied by secondary sources rather than direct mine output."}
{"text": "These secondary sources include: stocks and inventories of natural and enriched uranium, both civilian and military in origin; nuclear fuel from the reprocessing of spent reactor fuels and from surplus military plutonium; underfeeding; and uranium produced by the re-enrichment of depleted uranium tails."}
{"text": "Natural and enriched uranium stocks and inventories From the beginning of commercial exploitation of nuclear power in the late 1950s to 1990, uranium production consistently exceeded commercial requirements (see Figure 2.8)."}
{"text": "This was mainly the consequence of a lower than projected growth rate of nuclear generating capacity combined with high levels of production for strategic purposes."}
{"text": "This period of over production created a stockpile of uranium potentially available for use in commercial power plants."}
{"text": "After 1990, production fell well below demand and secondary supplies fed the market."}
{"text": "Since 2008, requirements increased slightly before declining again in the last few years owing to unplanned reactor closures in Germany and Japan following the Fukushima Daiichi accident."}
{"text": "The decline in requirements in 2018 was likely related to the reduced number of reactors being refuelled in Japan."}
{"text": "Uranium production since 2007 has generally increased and has partially closed the gap between production and reactor requirements."}
{"text": "However, more recently, producers have responded to the sustained uranium market downturn by temporarily shutting some operations and scaling back uranium production at other mines, thus a slight gap between supply and demand appeared again."}
{"text": "Following the political and economic reorganisation in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s, steps have been taken to move towards the development of an integrated global commercial market."}
{"text": "More uranium is now available from the former Soviet Union, most notably from Kazakhstan, but also from Russia and Uzbekistan."}

{"text": "7551, (c) OECD 2020 109 URANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP A key uncertainty of the uranium market continues to be the availability and the mobility of secondary sources, particularly the level of stocks available and the length of time remaining until those stocks are exhausted."}
{"text": "However, the possibility that at least a portion of the potentially large inventory (including from the military) will continue to make its way to the market after 2020 cannot be discounted."}
{"text": "These uncertainties complicate investment decisions on new production capability."}
{"text": "Another limiting factor for investment decisions is that uranium demand outlook in the near- to medium-term is driven primarily by the large number of reactors that are scheduled to close (e.g."}
{"text": "Europe and the United States), which offset the positive growth from new nuclear power plants in other countries (e.g."}
{"text": "China)."}
{"text": "It is clear that the generally stronger market of the 2003-2011 period, compared to the last two decades of the 20th century has driven exploration activity, thus building up an important uranium resources base."}
{"text": "However, history shows that periods of low prices for uranium and reliance on secondary supplies have had dramatic impacts on the industry in terms of consolidation of producers and significant reductions in primary production capability."}
{"text": "The long-term perspective Uranium demand is fundamentally driven by the number of operating reactors, which ultimately is driven by the demand for electricity."}
{"text": "The role that nuclear energy will play in helping meet projected electricity demand will depend on government policy decisions affecting nuclear development and how effectively a number of factors discussed earlier are addressed (e.g."}
{"text": "economics, safety, security of energy supply, waste disposal, environmental considerations)."}
{"text": "Public acceptance of nuclear technology in some countries remains an issue that needs to be addressed."}
{"text": "Several international agencies have noted that if governments follow the current path of energy policy, severe climate change impacts can be expected, and greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production are at the heart of this issue (IAEA, 2020c; IEA, 2019; NEA, 2015)."}
{"text": "In setting a goal of stopping growth in emissions, several policy measures have been proposed: implementation of select energy efficiency policies, limiting the use of inefficient coal power plants, reducing methane emissions from upstream oil and gas facilities, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and increasing investment in renewable energy technologies."}
{"text": "However, without action to provide more support for nuclear power, global efforts to mitigate climate change will become drastically harder and more costly (IEA, 2019)."}
{"text": "The \"World Energy Investment 2017\" report (IEA, 2017) also outlined that nuclear energy can make a significant contribution to decarbonisation, but the industry must receive clear and consistent policy support for existing and new capacity with nuclear also included in clean energy incentive schemes."}
{"text": "The 2020 World Energy Outlook (IEA, 2020) notes that following the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact on 2020 global energy demand varies by fuel, with falls of 8% in oil demand and 7% in coal use, in contrast to 4.5% for nuclear and a slight rise in the contribution of renewables."}
{"text": "Global electricity demand is estimated to drop only by 2% for 2020."}
{"text": "Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, energy demand was projected to increase by 12% between 2019 and 2030."}
{"text": "Growth over this period is now set to 9% in the Stated Policy Scenario, and 4% in the Delayed Recovery Scenario with increases coming from emerging markets and developing economies, led by India."}
{"text": "However, a different pathway, the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) together with the Sustainable Recovery Plan, was set by IEA, showing governments the opportunity to boost economic recovery, create jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions."}
{"text": "Full implementation of this scenario will require major investments in clean energy technologies over the next ten years, directed towards improvements in efficiency, low-emissions power and electricity grids, and more sustainable fuels."}
{"text": "To achieve the clean energy transition identified in the IEA's SDS, near-term actions to boost nuclear power, including supporting lifetime extensions and expanding new build projects including small modular reactors, are required."}
{"text": "Nevertheless, global investments in nuclear capacity continue to be insufficient, taking into account the small number of new build projects being started."}

{"text": "It concludes that air pollution, climate change and system costs constitute the largest un-internalised costs (NEA, 2017)."}
{"text": "The transition to a low-carbon electricity system also creates challenges."}
{"text": "The growing shares of variable renewable energy technologies have prompted a discussion among policy makers, regulators and system operators on the extent to which deregulated electricity markets can deliver the transition to a low-carbon power system while ensuring an adequate level of supply security and sufficient investment in network and generation capacities (NEA, 2018)."}
{"text": "Several alternative uses of nuclear energy also have the potential to increase nuclear power installation worldwide, including desalination and heat production for industrial and residential purposes."}
{"text": "The prospect of using nuclear energy for desalination on a large-scale is attractive since desalination is an energy intensive process that can make use of either the heat from a nuclear reactor and/or the electricity produced."}
{"text": "About one-third of the world's population lives in water stressed areas, with a majority in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, and with climate change, access to fresh water could become increasingly challenging (IAEA, 2020)."}

{"text": "China, Jordan, Libya and Qatar), building on experience gained through the operation of integrated nuclear desalination plants in India, Japan and Kazakhstan."}
{"text": "Global installed desalination capacity has more than doubled between 2006 and 2019, with the majority operating on fossil fuels."}
{"text": "Cogeneration, combining industrial heat applications with electricity generation, is not a new concept; some of the first civilian reactors in the world were used to supply heat as well as electricity."}
{"text": "District heating using heat generated in reactors has been used in some countries for decades."}
{"text": "Industrial process heating has also been used and potential for further development exists, but the extent to which reactors will be used for such applications will depend on the economics of heat transport, international pressure to reduce CO2 emissions and national desires to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, as well as competition with alternative heat or combined heat and power (CHP) technologies (IAEA, 2019b)."}
{"text": "It should be noted that since the public and decision makers are not sufficiently aware of the potential of non-electric applications of nuclear energy, better communication practices should be developed."}
{"text": "Energy use for transport, which is projected to continue to grow rapidly over the coming decades, is also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions."}
{"text": "Both electric and hydrogen-fuelled vehicles are seen as potential replacements for those powered by fossil fuels."}

{"text": "The current nuclear reactors use uranium fuel that is enriched up to 5% with uranium-235, the main fissile isotope that produces energy during a chain reaction."}
{"text": "HALEU is enriched between 5% and 20% and is required for many advanced reactors in order to optimise their systems for longer life cores, increased efficiencies and better fuel utilisation."}

{"text": "Deployment of advanced reactor and fuel cycle technologies could also significantly add to world energy supply in the long term."}
{"text": "Moving to advanced technology reactors and recycling fuel could increase the long-term availability of nuclear energy from hundreds to thousands of years."}

{"text": "These reports have been provided by official government organisations (see Appendix 1) responsible for the control of nuclear raw materials in their respective countries, although the details are the responsibility of the individual organisations concerned."}
{"text": "In countries where commercial companies are engaged in exploration, mining and production of uranium, the information is first submitted by these companies to the government of the host country and may then be transmitted to the NEA or the IAEA at the discretion of the government concerned."}
{"text": "In certain cases, where an official national report was not submitted, and where it was deemed helpful for the reader, the NEA/IAEA has provided additional comments or estimates to complete this report."}
{"text": "In such cases, \"NEA/IAEA estimates\" are clearly indicated."}
{"text": "It should be noted that exploration activities may be currently ongoing in a number of other countries that are not included in this report."}
{"text": "In addition, uranium resources may have been identified in some of these countries."}
{"text": "It is believed, however, that the total of these resources would not significantly affect the overall conclusions of this report."}
{"text": "Nevertheless, the NEA and IAEA encourage the governments of these countries to submit an official response to the questionnaire for the next edition of the Red Book."}
{"text": "Additional information on the world's uranium deposits is available in the IAEA online database World Distribution of Uranium Deposits UDEPO (www-nfcis.iaea.org)."}
{"text": "UDEPO contains information on location, ranges of uranium tonnage and average grade, geological type, status, operating organisations (in case the deposit is being mined), and other technical and geological details about the deposits."}
{"text": "Thirty-one member countries submitted a response to the questionnaire and the NEA/IAEA drafted fourteen country reports."}
{"text": "As a result, there are a total of 45 national reports in the following section."}

{"text": "7551, (c) OECD 2020 117 NATIONAL REPORTS: ALGERIA Algeria Uranium exploration and mine development Historical review Over the past 40 years, uranium exploration in Algeria, which began with the launching of the mineral prospecting programme in the Hoggar region, went through an initial phase (1969-1973) marked by a significant investment effort, which led to the discovery of the first uranium deposits in the Hoggar Precambrian crystalline basement (Timgaouine-Abankor-Tinef)."}
{"text": "These results, obtained through ground radiometric surveys and geological mapping, quickly identified the uranium resource potential of the Hoggar region, which overall has favourable geological and metallogenic characteristics for mineral deposits."}
{"text": "An aeromagnetic-spectrographic survey of the entire national territory carried out in 1971 provided the initial incentive and direction for uranium exploration."}
{"text": "The processing of the data collected from this survey identified potential regions for further uranium prospecting, including the Eglab, Ouggarta and Tin Serinine sedimentary basins (South Tassili; where the Tahaggart deposit was discovered), as well as individual areas in Tamart-n-Iblis and Timouzeline."}
{"text": "While these developments were taking place, uranium prospecting entered a new phase (1973-1981) primarily aimed and focused on the assessment of reserves and the exploitation of previously discovered deposits."}
{"text": "Despite a pronounced slowdown in prospecting activities in the phase that followed (1984-1997), work undertaken in the immediate vicinity of previously discovered deposits and in other promising areas revealed indications of uranium mineralisation and radiometric anomalies in the Amel and Tesnou zones situated in the north-west and north respectively of the Timgaouine region."}
{"text": "Surveys conducted in the Tin Seririne basin (Tassili south Hoggar) provided a basis on which undertake geologic mapping and revealed the distribution of uranium-bearing minerals in Palaeozoic sedimentary formations."}
{"text": "Recent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities In 2017 and 2018, preliminary prospecting work for undiscovered mineral resources (diamond, Au, PGE-Cr, Cu-Ni-PGE-Cr and Mo-Cu) of the Eglabs region including uranium resources related to granites, calcretes, alkaline rocks and carbonatites were carried out by the Agency of the Geological Service of Algeria in collaboration with the United States Geological Survey."}
{"text": "Uranium resources Identified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources) Reasonably assured resources in Algeria are of two geological types: upper Proterozoic vein deposits in the western Hoggar, and a deposit linked to the Precambrian basement and its Palaeozoic sedimentary unconformity in the central Hoggar."}
{"text": "The first type includes vein deposits linked to the faults traversing the Pan-African batholith in the Timgaouine region, represented by the Timgaouine, Abankor and Tinef deposits of the south-west Ahaggar."}
{"text": "118 URANIUM 2020: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No."}
{"text": "7551, (c) OECD 2020 NATIONAL REPORTS: ALGERIA The second type is unconformity-related represented by the Tahaggart deposit, which is associated with a weathering profile (regolith) developed at the interface between the Pre-Cambrian basement and the Palaeozoic cover, and to conglomerates at the base of the Palaeozoic sedimentary sequence in the Tin Seririne basin (south-east Hoggar)."}
{"text": "It is worth noting that the uranium mineralisation discovered in the Ait Oklan-El Bema (north Hoggar) region has not been assessed in terms of uranium resources."}
{"text": "Undiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources) Algeria does not report resources in any other category than reasonably assured resources."}

{"text": "This law aims to define the legislative and regulatory framework for activities related to the research, production and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, in compliance with Algeria's commitments under international conventions."}
{"text": "Uranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices National policies relating to uranium From a mining perspective, in a world market dominated in the short and medium term by a small number of producers, it is currently not economically feasible to exploit the uranium resources in Algeria."}
{"text": "Algeria's uranium resources can only be exploited in a sustainable manner as part of an integrated development of the nuclear sector and its main applications."}
{"text": "The latter include, in particular, nuclear power generation and seawater desalination plants, together with applications in medicine, agriculture, water resources and industry."}
{"text": "With regard to the current situation in the global energy market, Algeria is working towards the integrated development of the uranium sector, ranging from exploration to production and encompassing research and development, training and long-term nuclear power generation prospects."}
{"text": "Gaining control over the uranium production cycle and its applications would require the acquisition of technical expertise that can only be gained through ambitious research, development and training programmes."}
{"text": "Through its nuclear research centres, Algeria currently has the appropriate tools in place to start work in the future, either alone or through bilateral or multilateral co-operation on various research, development and training programmes."}
{"text": "It is in a spirit of openness and transparency that Algeria applied itself to the task of putting in place the most supportive and appropriate institutional and regulatory framework to provide a basis on which to pursue the energy development of the country, including a Mining Act, Electricity Act, an Oil and Gas Act and recently a civil nuclear activities Act."}
{"text": "To improve the mining sector and boost research, mining and exploration, the government amended Law 01-10 (from 3 July 2001) by the enactment of Law 14-05 on 24 February 2014."}

{"text": "7551, (c) OECD 2020 NATIONAL REPORTS: ARGENTINA Argentina Uranium exploration and mine development Historical review Uranium exploration activities in Argentina were launched in 1951-1952 by the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA), leading to the discovery of the Papagayos, Huemul, Don Otto and Los Berthos uranium deposits."}
{"text": "During the late 1950s and the early 1960s, airborne surveys also led to the discovery of the Los Adobes sandstone deposits in Patagonia."}
{"text": "During the 1960s, the Schlagintweit and La Estela vein deposits were discovered and subsequently mined."}
{"text": "During the 1970s, follow-up exploration near the previously discovered uranium occurrences in Patagonia led to the discovery of two new sandstone deposits: Cerro Condor and Cerro Solo."}
{"text": "At the end of the 1980s, a nationwide exploration programme was undertaken to evaluate geological units with uranium potential."}
{"text": "The CNEA selected the Cerro Solo sandstone-type uranium-molybdenum deposit to perform an assessment project in 1990, based on the deposit's promising grade."}
{"text": "Mineralised layers are distributed in fluvial sandstone conglomerates belonging to the Cretaceous Chubut Group, at depths of 50 to 130 m. An intensive exploration programme was developed to define the main morphological features of the orebodies and the mineralisation model, to update resource estimates, and to select preliminary mining-milling methods to carry out an economic assessment of the project."}
{"text": "From 1990 to 1997, exploration was conducted in the vicinity of the Cerro Solo deposit (Chubut Province), where more than 56 000 m was drilled to test the potential of favourable portions of the paleochannel structure."}
{"text": "The results included the localisation and partial evaluation of specific mineralised bodies with a content of recoverable uranium resources estimated at 4 600 tU of reasonably assured and inferred resources."}
{"text": "These results allowed the CNEA to carry out a programme to complete a preliminary economic assessment of the Cerro Solo U-Mo deposit in 1997, including a revised geological model and ore resource estimate, mining and milling methods and their costs, cash flow and risk analysis, as well as the exploration and evaluation of the surrounding areas."}
{"text": "As a result of the policy to reactivate the nuclear programme announced in August 2006 by the national government, active exploration/evaluation on different areas of uranium interest have subsequently been undertaken."}
{"text": "From 2007 to 2016, a total of 45 672 m have been drilled (380 boreholes) into the main mineralised areas of the Cerro Solo district, including 7 701 m of core (58 boreholes) and 37 971 m of cutting sample (322 boreholes)."}
{"text": "A total of 44 246 m have been drilled (373 boreholes) at the Cerro Solo uranium deposit, including 6 276 m of core (51 boreholes), which were sampled as the focus of mineralogical and hydrometallurgical studies and triaxial strength tests; and 37 970 m of cutting samples (322 boreholes), which were sampled as the focus of stratigraphic correlation and metallogenic studies."}
{"text": "It is worth mentioning that all drill holes were logged using caliper, long and short resistivity, spontaneous potential and gamma ray."}
{"text": "Some tests were also performed with a sonic probe and a gamma-ray spectrometry probe."}

{"text": "7551, (c) OECD 2020 121 NATIONAL REPORTS: ARGENTINA Other areas under study at Chubut Province are the Sierra Cuadrada Uranium District, located in the southeastern part of the province, where at least four uranium-mineralised areas were recognised."}
{"text": "Three of them Sierra Cuadrada, Sierra Cuadrada Sur and La Meseta are defined as \"statements of discovery\" (SD), which means that there is a legal document certifying the discovery of these new mines or mining areas."}
{"text": "The fourth one, which has not been defined as an \"SD\", is the Union exploration area."}
{"text": "In the Sierra Cuadrada Uranium District, a regional geological survey was carried out in an area of 4 000 ha with geological-radiometric data collection within three semi-regional profiles."}
{"text": "Subsequently, four holes were drilled at SD Sierra Cuadrada (two holes) and SD Sierra Cuadrada Sur (two holes), accounting for a total of 585 m. Two hundred kilometres north of the Sierra Cuadrada District, a discovery was made at the SD Mirasol Chico and SD El Cruce, where uranium ore is related to fluvial and lacustrine deposits of Cretaceous age."}
{"text": "In the SD El Cruce, radiometric prospecting was followed by four drill holes with core sample recovery, resulting in 647 m, and logged with downhole tools to obtain electric profiles."}
{"text": "The core samples were used to obtain lithological, chemical and radiometric determinations."}
{"text": "At SD Mirasol Chico, the geological-topographic map was updated, covering an area of 2 000 ha, providing a base map to plan the drilling programme of 507 m (3 holes) executed in 2015."}
{"text": "Regarding environmental preservation in the areas where exploration is conducted, monitoring networks are being implemented, adjusting the number of sampling points according to the knowledge and progress of the stage of the mining project."}
{"text": "In the south of Argentina (Santa Cruz province), exploration has primarily focused on shallow low-grade uranium anomalies in six areas of surficial deposits (calcrete-type), and within the Laguna Sirven area the focus is on defining the extension and continuity of uranium mineralisation to depths between 0.5 and 3 m. Mining properties are shared by FOMICRUZ S.E."}
{"text": "and the CNEA."}
{"text": "At Laguna Sirven, laboratory hydrometallurgical tests have demonstrated that if the fine fraction can be separated (about 35% of the total volume) and concentrated by screening, the original grade could be doubled."}
{"text": "In the Urcal and Urcuschun deposits, located in La Rioja Province, uranium mineralisation is associated with limestone deposits from the Ordovician-aged San Juan Formation with chert and fault and fracture planes."}
{"text": "It is also related to a sedimentary sequence from the CarbonoPermian Paganzo Group."}
{"text": "Exploration activities included vertical and semi-regional detailed geological profile surveys, geological and topographic map updates, as well as re-examination of old mining activities."}
{"text": "Samples from mineralised zones were the subject of metallogenic studies."}
{"text": "Following this work, activities were focused on geophysical exploration by means of standard geoelectrical methods and through the implementation of the dipole-dipole method."}
{"text": "Those efforts were the foundation for the design of the drilling programme of 993 m (13 drilled holes) implemented in 2015."}
{"text": "In the SDs Alipan I, Velasco Range, La Rioja Province (defined as a granite-related uraniumtype, perigranitic subtype deposit), systematic geochemical studies in new trenches were continued; two geological profile surveys with samples of water, rock and sediments were carried out, and geophysical exploration (audio-magnetotelluric and geoelectrical) to obtain structural and lithological information at depth was introduced."}
{"text": "As a result, it was determined that the mineralised block occupies a \"sloping\" position towards the east over the oxidised sterile block."}
{"text": "Between 2010 and 2013, 14 drilling programmes were conducted for a total of 2 344 m. The other four planned programmes were not undertaken due to anti-mining actions by local authorities and non-governmental organisations since 2013."}
{"text": "Over the eastern side of Velasco Range, towards the north of SD Alipan I, a new area of exploration called Lucero is being studied, where results are encouraging and three zones with anomalies and evidence of surface uranium minerals were defined."}

{"text": "7551, (c) OECD 2020 NATIONAL REPORTS: ARGENTINA Gamma radiometric exploration airborne test surveys have been carried out with CNEA equipment on four sites within the Cordoba Ranges, reintroducing the application of an exploration technique that had been halted for decades."}
{"text": "In Vaqueria Range, Salta Province, and San Buenaventura Range, Catamarca Province, a zone of over 100 000 ha, which corresponds to 12 exploration permit areas, was liberated because it did not have the frequency and concentration of uranium mineralisation associated with Cretaceous-aged sandstone deposits that was expected."}
{"text": "At the Mina Franca deposit, classified as a granite-related, perigranitic subtype uranium deposit, located in Fiambala Range, Catamarca Province, surface systematic radiometric survey and geological-structural-metallogenic mapping have been undertaken, while mineralogical and geochemical analyses in the central and south sectors of Mina Franca have also been carried out."}
{"text": "In 2017, surface geological reconnaissance activities were completed, which provided the structural geological base map used to plan a drill programme to define mineralisation at depth."}
{"text": "Simultaneously, a monitoring plan for water and sediment modules has been implemented as part of the baseline environmental survey."}
{"text": "Moreover, communication programmes related to exploration activities in the Fiambala Range and nuclear technology applications are being conducted in neighbouring populations and provincial offices."}
{"text": "With the aim of studying mineralisation behaviour in detail in the north and centre sectors of the Don Otto deposit, Salta Province, which has been classified as Cretaceous-aged sandstone-type uranium deposit, geophysical techniques (geoelectrical and magnetotelluric methods) were applied in order to collect subsoil data on the existing stratigraphic and structural sequence."}
{"text": "Other activities conducted in the district included geomorphological studies, identification of depositional settings, lithological facies and ichnofacies."}
{"text": "These efforts were complemented with a drilling programme of 8 drill holes totalling 1 734 m. Evidence of uranium found in oil wells, and to a lesser extent, known from surface data, is under investigation in two exploration areas near Catriel, in the Rio Negro Province."}
{"text": "Mineralisation is related to sedimentary deposits within the Neuquen Basin, and therefore could be classified as a sandstone-type uranium deposit."}
{"text": "Exploration undertaken during 2015 and 2016 involved the application of geophysical techniques including an audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) study and vertical electrical sounding (VES)."}
{"text": "These studies were complemented with geochemical exploration and geological radiometric reconnaissance programmes in semiregional profiles."}
{"text": "The studies seeked to obtain a wider knowledge about subsoil geology and identifying uranium anomalies."}
{"text": "In order to detect uranium anomalies, a drilling programme of 1 910 m distributed in 10 drill holes was implemented."}
{"text": "Similar activities were also carried out on four exploration properties within the area of Las Mahuidas."}
{"text": "Some semi-regional geological recognition activities, including geochemical surveys and geophysical studies (AMT and VES), were conducted in an exploration area in Gobernador Ayala, La Pampa Province."}
{"text": "The results of the resistivity soundings had considerable correlation with oil well logs that show a radiometric anomaly at a depth of less than 200 m. Based on this information, a drilling programme was planned."}
{"text": "In the framework of an IAEA Coordinated Research Project on \"Geochemical and Mineralogical Characterisation of Uranium and Thorium Deposits\", the interpretation of new studies on uranium mineralisation from several uranium sites of interest has improved the metallogenetic understanding of the granite-related deposits and the exploration guidelines."}

{"text": "Uranium production Historical review Argentina produced uranium from the mid-1950s until 1999, with a total of seven commercialscale production centres and a pilot plant that operated between 1953 and 1970."}
{"text": "The closure of one of the last of these facilities in 1995 (Los Colorados) resulted in a change in the ownership structure of uranium production in Argentina, and since 1996, the uranium mining industry has been wholly owned by CNEA."}
{"text": "The last facility that remained operative at that time, San Rafael, was placed on standby in 1997."}
{"text": "No uranium has been produced since then, neither privately nor by state."}
{"text": "Between the mid-1950s and 1997, cumulative uranium production totalled 2 582 tU."}
{"text": "Status of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities and other issues Production projects Argentina produced about 120 tU/year for about 20 years to provide raw material to fuel its nuclear power plants Atucha I and Embalse, with ore from different sites distributed throughout the national territory."}
{"text": "However, in the late 1990s, the decline in the international price of uranium made domestic production no longer competitive, and the decision to shut down the remaining production plants and import uranium was taken."}
{"text": "Nevertheless, changes in recent years have resulted in CNEA reviewing its plans and considering reopening production facilities."}
{"text": "These changes include mainly uncertainties related to future external supply, and increases in domestic uranium requirements related to full capacity operation of the Atucha II reactor, which was reached in 2015."}
{"text": "These uncertainties and increases are in part related to the Embalse plant, that was not producing power for two years due to refurbishing designed to extend its useful life for a term of 30 years, which included an increase in its power by an additional 35 MWe."}
{"text": "With an approximate installed capacity of 1.7 GWe, natural uranium requirements are about 220 tU per year."}
{"text": "The potential addition of one new pressurised water reactor, and the development of the CAREM-25 prototype and CAREM-120 commercial reactors, will further increase the domestic uranium requirement, which could reach approximately 500 tU/year by 2030."}

{"text": "This study evaluated the potential impacts of uranium concentrate and dioxide production and the treatment of the former wastes simultaneously."}
{"text": "The EIA concluded that former operations had not affected the quality of underground and surface waters in the area, or any other environmental component in the surrounding area."}
{"text": "Provincial authorities nonetheless rejected this proposal, arguing that CNEA must first remediate the open-pit water and the milling wastes stored in drums before restarting the production."}
{"text": "In response, CNEA prepared and submitted a new EIA (2006) addressing only the treatment of wastes in temporary storage and pit water."}
{"text": "This proposal received technical approval, but not final approval because it lacked the required statutory public hearing."}
{"text": "A further complication that increased the difficulty of reopening the plant was the approval of Mendoza Provincial Act 7722 (2007) that prohibits the use of sulphuric acid, among other chemicals, in mining activities."}
{"text": "Currently, CNEA is building evaporation ponds and defining the basic engineering for the simultaneous treatment of open-pit water and milling wastes stored at the San Rafael complex."}
{"text": "To date, three effluent evaporation ponds have been finished and one more is under construction."}
{"text": "In 2018, an update to EIA 2006 (EIA, 2013), presented to the provincial control authorities, was received favourably, with technical opinion and a public hearing mandatory by law held in 2019 yielding positive outcomes."}
{"text": "Consequently, the provincial authorities granted the EIA by Resolution Ndeg 259/19."}
{"text": "CNEA secured sufficient funds for the rehabilitation of former uranium production facilities from the Bank for Investment Projects in the Ministry of Economy."}
{"text": "An approved budget provided more time and resources could be devoted to addressing the remediation and rehabilitation."}
{"text": "These activities involved the removal of obsolete facilities, construction of effluent ponds, purchase of equipment and facilities, and other associated work."}
{"text": "Before restarting uranium production in San Rafael, it was necessary to obtain both provincial approval and agreement to amend the provincial law that prevents the use of sulphuric acid, among other chemicals."}
{"text": "Technical feasibility has been partially demonstrated by the fact that this deposit was previously in operation, using an acid heap-leaching mining method."}
{"text": "Other alternatives have been considered for possible future production, including the use of alkaline leaching, bioleaching and vat leaching."}
{"text": "Also, given the possibility of the reopening of the mining-milling complex, all available data have been processed to redefine the geological model and formulate a more suitable mining design."}
{"text": "The Cerro Solo Project CNEA continues developing feasibility studies for the proposed mining of the Cerro Solo deposit (Chubut Province), and several laboratory-scale tests have been carried out to determine the most economic milling process."}
{"text": "Since the deposit contains molybdenum in addition to uranium, identifying an appropriate and feasible process is not trivial."}
{"text": "Molybdenum could be a valuable by-product, but its presence in the leachate could compromise the exchange resins, so another process, like liquid-liquid extraction, may be used."}
{"text": "For this reason, all preliminary investigations have been critical steps in developing a profitable production plan."}
{"text": "Recently, the conceptual engineering design has been developed."}
{"text": "In the mining sector, a conceptual study was advanced and improved using specific software for geological modelling."}

{"text": "This resulted in discovering 16 low-grade uranium deposits of varying sizes in the SSZ, Jharkhand and one deposit at Umra, Rajasthan."}
{"text": "Seven out of the fourteen deposits in the SSZ are under exploitation."}
{"text": "Exploration is currently being carried out in several sectors of the 160 km long SSZ."}
{"text": "Subsequent investigations were expanded to other favourable geological domains, which resulted in establishing several small uranium deposits such as Bodal and Bhandaritola, Chhattisgarh in Paleoproterozoic amphibolites; Jajawal, Chhattisgarh in Paleoproterozoic sheared migmatites of the Chhotanagpur Granite Gneiss Complex; and Walkunji, Karnataka in basal quartz-pebble conglomerates of the Dharwar Group."}
{"text": "During the mid-1970s, exploration was initiated targeting sandstone-type uranium deposits."}

{"text": "Exploration in contiguous sectors has established several small uranium deposits."}
{"text": "During the mid-1980s, a low-grade, stratabound deposit hosted by dolostones of the Vempalle Formation was established at Tummalapalle, Andhra Pradesh in the Cuddapah Basin."}
{"text": "Since the dolostone ore was not amenable for conventional leaching procedures in vogue at that time, exploration in this sector was discontinued."}
{"text": "However, the development of an economically viable alkali pressure leaching process rejuvenated the exploration activities in the Vempalle Formation along the Southern part of the Cuddapah Basin, targeting carbonate-hosted uranium mineralisation."}
{"text": "Intensive multi-parametric exploration was carried out in Tummalapalle and adjacent sectors and led to the identification of substantial uranium resources."}
{"text": "During the early 1990s, a near-surface deposit was discovered adjacent to the unconformity contact between basement granites and the overlying Proterozoic Srisailam Quartzite at Lambapur in the Nalgonda district, Andhra Pradesh."}
{"text": "These occurrences were investigated and several exploration areas were subsequently identified."}
{"text": "Favourable geological criteria and sustained exploration efforts resulted in establishing deposits at Peddagattu and Chitrial."}

{"text": "Mining commenced in 1976 at Rossing and exploration intensified as uranium prices increased sharply."}
{"text": "However, in the early 1980s, the sharp decline in uranium prices caused rapid curtailment of exploration and mine development efforts."}
{"text": "This was untimely as refined and proven exploration techniques appeared poised to discover new deposits."}
{"text": "Beginning in 2003, rising uranium prices once again stimulated extensive exploration activity, mainly in the Namib Desert."}
{"text": "Based on earlier successes, two major types of deposits were targeted: intrusive-type associated with alaskite, as at Rossing, and surficial, calcrete-type deposits, as at Langer Heinrich."}
{"text": "In 2002, Paladin Energy bought the Langer Heinrich tenement and in 2005 started construction of the Langer Heinrich mine that officially opened five years later."}
{"text": "That same year, French state-owned Orano (at that time Areva) purchased Trekkopje from the Canadian company UraMin and began construction of an alkaline heap leach mine in 2008, as well as an associated seawater desalination plant."}
{"text": "Production of 3 000 tU was initially expected to start in early 2010, but decreased demand following the financial crisis and lower uranium prices after the Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan led Orano to place Trekkopje on care and maintenance in 2013, following completion of the Phase 2 pilot tests."}

{"text": "The first is a bicarbonateacid method that is used for ores with a carbonate content above 2%."}
{"text": "It is based on bicarbonate ion generation during the soft acidification stage, which oxidises and dissolves uranium minerals."}
{"text": "This method reduces the kinetics of the leaching process, but chemical plugging may occur at the final leaching stage."}
{"text": "The repair and restoration procedures for wells is reduced by 2.5-3 times using this method."}
{"text": "The second method uses a mini-reagent technology that is applied for ores with a carbonate content >0.5% located in an artesian aquifer."}
{"text": "At the first stage, a preliminary ore oxidation occurs by pumping compressed air into the aquifer."}
{"text": "At the second stage, slightly acidic solutions, formed during aquifer saturation with atmospheric oxygen, dissolve the contained uranium."}
{"text": "The implementation of these two technologies has significantly reduced acid consumption and in turn operating costs by 20-30%."}

{"text": "1 short ton U3O8 1% U3O8 1 USD/lb U3O8 1 tonne = 0.769 tU = 0.848% U = USD 2.6/kg U = 1 metric ton Resource terminology Resource estimates are divided into separate categories reflecting different levels of confidence in the quantities reported."}
{"text": "The resources are further separated into categories based on the cost of production."}
{"text": "Definitions of resource categories Uranium resources are broadly classified as either conventional or unconventional."}
{"text": "Conventional resources are those that have an established history of production where uranium is a primary product, co-product or an important by-product (e.g."}
{"text": "from the mining of copper and gold)."}
{"text": "Very low-grade resources or those from which uranium is only recoverable as a minor byproduct are considered unconventional resources."}
{"text": "Conventional resources are further divided, according to different confidence levels of occurrence, into four categories."}
{"text": "The correlation between these resource categories and those used in selected national resource classification systems is shown in Figure A3.1."}
{"text": "Reasonably assured resources (RAR) refers to uranium that occurs in known mineral deposits of delineated size, grade and configuration such that the quantities, which could be recovered within the given production cost ranges with currently proven mining and processing technology, can be specified."}
{"text": "Estimates of tonnage and grade are based on specific sample data and measurements of the deposits and on knowledge of deposit characteristics."}
{"text": "Reasonably assured resources have a high assurance of existence."}
{"text": "Unless otherwise noted, RAR are expressed in terms of quantities of uranium recoverable from mineable ore (see: recoverable resources)."}
{"text": "Inferred resources (IR) refers to uranium, in addition to RAR, that is inferred to occur based on direct geological evidence, in extensions of well-explored deposits, or in deposits in which geological continuity has been established but where specific data, including measurements of the deposits, and knowledge of the deposit's characteristics, are considered to be inadequate to classify the resource as RAR."}
{"text": "Estimates of tonnage, grade and cost of further delineation and recovery are based on such sampling as is available and on knowledge of the deposit characteristics as determined in the best known parts of the deposit or in similar deposits."}
{"text": "Less reliance can be placed on the estimates in this category than on those for RAR."}

{"text": "Less reliance can be placed on the estimates in this category than on those for inferred resources."}
{"text": "Prognosticated resources are normally expressed in terms of uranium contained in mineable ore, i.e."}
{"text": "in situ quantities."}
{"text": "Speculative resources (SR) refers to uranium, in addition to prognosticated resources, that is thought to exist, mostly on the basis of indirect evidence and geological extrapolations, in deposits discoverable with existing exploration techniques."}
{"text": "The location of deposits envisaged in this category could generally be specified only as being somewhere within a given region or geological trend."}
